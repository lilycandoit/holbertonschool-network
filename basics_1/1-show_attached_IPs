# This script prints all active IPv4 addresses on the machine.

# Use ip command to list IPv4 addresses, then filter with awk.
# - ip -4 addr show → shows only IPv4 addresses
# - awk '/inet/ {print $2}' → prints the "IP/mask"
# - cut -d/ -f1 → removes the subnet mask, leaving just the IP
# ip -4 addr show | awk '/inet/ {print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
